## Overview

### The challenge

Your users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

### Links

-  Live Site URL:

## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  Flexbox
-  Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
:root {
   background: hsl(229, 57%, 11%) url('/images/bg-desktop.png') no-repeat bottom /
      100% 52.5%;
}
```

The background SVG for this project was at first difficult to control, since it would continue to scale either vertically or horizontally as the viewport increased. Yet while experimenting with the size of the asset, I discovered that providing a fixed vertical size in either px or at 100%, with a fluid horizontal size allowed the SVG to only scale along the x axis. In this instance it works quite nicely, but I am aware not all assets will look pleasant if they're continually stretched.

```css
.logo-container__icons-container {
   display: flex;
   flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

I decided to experiment with the icons container by controlling it via flex, so that when I added additional icons into the markup the layout was able to account for this in a dynamic manner. This contrasted to my previous approach where I aligned the icons via the `vertical-align` property, a style which would need to be replicated for each new icon added.

```css
.data-container__meter::after {
   height: 14px;
   width: 14px;
   right: 24.5%;
   bottom: 3px;
   box-shadow: 0 0 3px 0 white;
}
```

The fluid and responsive positioning of the progress bar and circle pseudo element within also became a nice challenge featured in this project. I had to provide a fluid percentage value horizontally so the circle would respond with its parent bar and not become mis-aligned, whilst applying a fixed px size and box-shadow to achieve the glow effect.

### Continued development

Further clip path uses - same use case past two projects (with Sunnyside Agency) although seems quite specific + niche use-cases

Further background img control - experimenting (always possible to control them - yet when first setup can seem very difficult)

### Useful resources

-  [Using CSS Clip Paths](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-clipping-paths) - This tutorial taught me all the basics about using clip paths, alongside some practical examples such as creating an effect where text can blend in with background images via 'clipping' certain shapes to hide the text at specific points.
